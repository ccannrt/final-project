It is the first places many prospective park visitors will get information about parks: Where to go, what to do, when they should go, where to park, accessibility info, etc.. As a result, nps.gov serves a wide range of users, from teenage to retired, all 50 states and international, and folks of all interests, backgrounds, and abilities.</p>

                    <p>A comparative analysis of seven sites and applications was conducted to see what other sites and apps have done to solve similar problems, and observe any patterns between them. The sites or apps analyzed were recreation.gov, expedia.com, wanderlog.com, zillow.com, the National Park Service mobile app, National Park Trail Guide mobile app by Adventure Projects, and alltrails.com.</p>

                    <ul class="research-findings">
                        <li>All sites included a map as an option for viewing POIs. Five of the seven sites featured the map as the primary display.</li>
                        <li>All of the maps were interactive, allowing you to scroll, zoom, and click on POI icons to see more information. Sites/apps related to hiking displayed trails with a colored path.</li>
                        <li>Some of the maps remained fixed as the respective POI list scrolled. In these cases selecting a POI on the map selected the POI listing and vice versa. When the map scrolled with the rest of the page, POIs within the map did not directly interact with the POIs in the list and vice versa.</li>
                        <li>For all sites or apps except the National Park Service mobile app, the list and map of POIs contained all POIs--barring applying a filter. You would not need to navigate to another page to view additional listings for the same location.</li>

                            <p>Interviewee 1 is a graduate student studying environmental policy. She visits National Parks several times a year and has gone on a few large road-trips, some solo and some with groups. She likes planning out a general sketch of what she wants to do before leaving on a trip but leave room for flexibility. Because of her interest in the outdoors, she’s motivated to go off the beaten-path and discover parks’ hidden gems.</p>

He and his wife go on trips to visit National Parks every few years, and have recently gone on a multi-state trip last summer. They prefer staying in hotels and visiting Parks during the day, or renting an RV and staying in Parks’ RV parks.</p>
